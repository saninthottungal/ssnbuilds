I'm Trish, a backend developer who loves building things that work well and are easy to use. I enjoy solving problems, making code simple, and learning new things every day.

Right now, I'm preparing for my masters and hoping to get into a good college. I like to draw, but I'm not really into designing. I enjoy making pixel art in my free time, and sometimes I play video games (but not too much!).

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, or sharing insights with the developer community.
